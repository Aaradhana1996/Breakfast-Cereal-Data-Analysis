# Breakfast-Cereal-Data-Analysis

This work is based on the breakfast cereal dataset. It has 77 different breakfast cereals (i.e. 77 observations), with 15 different variables observed for each observation. I used extensive analysis and visualisations to decide on the variables used in the linear regression model for the dataset.
